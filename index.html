                Hi there! My name is Andres Cardenas, im 19 years old and i like to game, <br>
                I was born in Orlando Florida, mostly raised here. I also live in colombia for 4 <br>
                years when i was around 5. <br>
                <br>
                I recently became vegetarian, ive been trying to go green on multiple things lately.<br>
                Ive also wanted to grow as a person, become wiser and smarter, live a healtier lifestyle.<br>
                Its good for health and the soul. Everyone has different perspectives of life ,<br>
                neither do i judge another person's view on life and how they want to live it.<br>

                We all have one life, so lets spend that time right.
